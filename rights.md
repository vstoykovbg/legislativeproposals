## Title: Urgent Need for EU Policy Reform to Protect Rights of Individuals Without Valid ID in Emergency Situations

Current EU and national policies inadvertently strip legally residing individuals of their basic rights if they lose or have their identification documents stolen. Strict identification requirements prevent access to essential services, as hotels, fast loan providers, and money transfer services are mandated to deny service to those without government-issued IDs. In Bulgaria, bureaucratic obstacles prevent timely issuance of replacement IDs, further compounding the problem. This situation leaves vulnerable individuals at risk of exploitation, including sexual exploitation, due to the lack of accessible legal financial support. Urgent legislative reforms are needed to protect citizens’ rights and ensure they can access essential services during crises.

Dear Members of the European Commission,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the current policies affecting individuals who find themselves without valid identification documents in the European Union, particularly in Bulgaria. It is troubling that existing frameworks not only fail to provide adequate support but also strip legally residing individuals of their fundamental rights, effectively rendering them invisible and vulnerable in times of need.

The European Union's commitment to upholding human rights, dignity, and non-discrimination is enshrined in various treaties and regulations. However, the current requirements imposed by member states—including strict identification laws that prohibit hotels and financial service providers from offering services without government-issued ID—contradict this commitment. This creates a situation where individuals, often through no fault of their own, are denied access to essential services simply because they have lost or had their identification stolen.

In Bulgaria, the situation is exacerbated by legislative interpretations that complicate the issuance of new identity documents. As it stands, individuals cannot obtain a replacement ID without first proving that the old document has been stolen or paying the required fee in advance. This requirement is particularly harsh for those who have lost their wallet, phone, or money during a theft, as they are often unable to pay upfront for a new document. Although the law states that fees should not be collected in cases of stolen IDs, the prevailing practice demands a court-issued document as proof of theft, rendering the process inaccessible for many.

Additionally, legally operating companies that provide fast loans are mandated to request government-issued IDs, make copies of these documents, and face fines for non-compliance. This regulatory framework effectively bars individuals without valid IDs from obtaining loans from legitimate lenders, placing them in precarious situations and leaving them vulnerable to exploitation, including the risk of sexual exploitation, as they may turn to unregulated and unsafe avenues to secure financial assistance.

Moreover, the situation is further complicated by legally operating money transmitters, such as Western Union, which no longer allow individuals to receive funds using just a password instead of a government-issued ID. The tightening of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws has made it increasingly difficult for individuals without proper identification to access funds sent to them, exacerbating their challenges. While governments have sought to strengthen these regulations, they have failed to ensure that individuals who fall victim to identity theft are adequately protected and supported during their time of need.

This not only contravenes the spirit of various EU laws—such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which protects the right to dignity and non-discrimination—but also undermines the principles of the EU’s internal market, which thrives on free movement and equal treatment of individuals across member states. The restrictive measures inadvertently foster a climate of fear and exclusion, making it increasingly difficult for citizens to navigate their lives after experiencing a loss of identification.

In light of these pressing issues, I wholeheartedly support the proposed reforms aimed at empowering individuals in emergencies without valid documentation. The suggested legislative changes, including deferred payment options for identity documents and the introduction of biometric verification methods, are essential to ensure that no individual is left without access to critical services due to circumstances beyond their control.

Furthermore, I urge the European Commission to take immediate action to align national policies with the EU’s foundational principles. It is vital that we establish a framework that not only protects individuals in their time of need but also enhances the overall resilience of our societies against future crises.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I hope to see a proactive approach taken to ensure that all individuals within the EU can live with dignity and access the services they need, regardless of their identification status.


# Empowering Individuals in Emergencies Without Valid Documentation

To address challenges related to accessing essential identification documents and financial services for individuals in emergencies without valid documentation, I propose a series of legislative reforms within the European framework. These reforms aim to increase member states' responsiveness in cases of emergencies by adjusting identification issuance policies, refining anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, and allowing financial service providers to better meet emergency needs. To support these initiatives, it is essential that the law offers entrepreneurs clear and unambiguous legal certainty, ensuring that businesses assisting individuals without identification operate within a secure legal framework.

These proposals are designed to assist financially stable individuals who are temporarily unable to access their funds or identification due to unforeseen circumstances, such as loss or theft. These measures are not intended to support undocumented immigrants, as biometric verification protocols ensure compliance with immigration, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism policies.

### Legislative Reform Proposals:

1. **Deferred Payment for Identification Documents**  
   - **Objective**: Require EU member states to implement a deferred payment option for issuing or replacing national identification documents, allowing individuals in financial hardship to acquire essential identification without pre-payment.
   - **Reasoning**: This measure enables individuals in urgent need of identification to meet critical personal and financial requirements (e.g., accessing bank accounts, obtaining emergency loans) without the barrier of upfront fees. Deferred payments could be collected via existing tax and debt collection channels, minimizing misuse.

2. **Revised AML and Security Compliance for Identity Verification Using Biometric Data**  
   - **Objective**: Permit financial and hospitality providers to use biometric identification as an alternative to document-based verification, supporting emergency services for individuals without physical ID while upholding AML and security standards.
   - **Implementation**: Providers may rely on biometric verification methods (e.g., facial recognition, palm vein scans) previously recorded at the initial agreement phase, with all records subject to anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism, and immigration review processes. This ensures compliance while allowing service providers to meet urgent needs, such as emergency loans or accommodation.

3. **Enhanced Biometric Data Sharing for Emergency Verification and Cross-Provider Authentication**  
   - **Objective**: Enable financial institutions to securely share biometric data with each other and with relevant authorities, facilitating identity verification for individuals in emergencies and supporting counter-terrorism efforts.
   - **Implementation**:
      - **For Individuals with No Prior Biometric Record**: If an individual lacks a pre-existing biometric record with any provider, new biometric data (e.g., a photo or palm vein scans) may be collected alongside self-declared personal information. This data would be submitted to national security agencies for review, especially in cases of suspected AML, immigration violations, or terrorism risks.
      - **For Existing Biometric Records**: Financial providers may request identity confirmation from third-party providers holding biometric data on the individual, streamlining cross-verification. Upon verification, the requesting provider would receive a copy of the ID to satisfy AML and counter-terrorism protocols.
      - **Additional Measures to Reduce Misuse**: To ensure only genuine cases benefit, service providers may impose a state-regulated fee. Data access for verification purposes would be controlled by national security and AML authorities, ensuring a balance between rapid support and security compliance.

4. **Facilitation of Mobile Identification Services Across Regions**  
   - **Objective**: Ensure that individuals can access identification services regardless of their regional registration, enhancing accessibility.
   - **Implementation**: Allow requests and issuance of identity documents at any administrative office within a member state, regardless of residency registration, to reduce travel needs and provide timely assistance in emergencies.

### Conclusion:

These proposed reforms to European identification and AML legislation will enable a responsive, secure framework that addresses the needs of EU residents in emergencies. Integrating deferred payment, biometric verification, inter-provider biometric data sharing, and mobile service access, these amendments provide essential support while maintaining robust security against illegal immigration, money laundering, and terrorism.
