My suggestion S33197923 at European Comission's website: [Urgent Need for EU Policy Reform to Protect Rights of Individuals Without Valid ID in Emergency Situations](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say-simplify/suggestions/S33197923_en)

[My suggestion S33197923 in MD format](rights.md)

## I got a reply:

> Thank you for submitting your suggestion to simplify, reduce potential burdens or future-proof existing EU laws for the benefit of citizens or businesses.
> 
> The Fit for Future Platform’s mandate has ended and its work is concluded.
> 
> Access to the services mentioned in your suggestion is typically possible with at least two types of documents: identity cards and passports. At least for those persons holding both types of documents, the loss of one can be compensated by using the other one. In the context of financial services, identity verification is particularly crucial, primarily to mitigate money laundering risks.
> 
> The responsibility for ensuring the prompt issuance of identity cards lies with the Member States. Any failures in the timely issuance of such documents should not be compensated by lowering security standards in areas where robust customer identification is essential.

Looks like I was misunderstood.

## My response to that reply:

Thank you for your response to my proposal regarding the urgent need for EU policy reform to protect individuals without valid identification in emergency situations. I appreciate your consideration of this matter and the importance of maintaining robust customer identification standards to mitigate risks such as money laundering.

However, I believe my proposal has been misunderstood, as it does not advocate for reducing security standards but rather suggests a more secure and accessible alternative for identity verification in emergencies.

### Key Points of My Proposal:

1. **Biometric Identification as a More Secure Alternative**
   - My proposal recommends the use of biometric verification (e.g., palm vein scans or facial recognition) as a means to securely verify an individual’s identity when government-issued ID is unavailable due to loss or theft.
   - Unlike traditional identification documents, which can be forged or used fraudulently, biometric identifiers are unique and nearly impossible to falsify.
   - This system would enhance security rather than compromise it, ensuring that only the rightful individual can access financial services, accommodations, or emergency assistance.

2. **Addressing the Delay in Issuing Replacement Identification**
   - While it is true that Member States are responsible for issuing identity documents, the reality is that the process can be slow and bureaucratic.
   - A person who has lost their ID may need immediate access to financial services or accommodation, yet current policies prevent them from legally obtaining these essential services.
   - The implementation of biometric verification would allow for immediate, secure identification, ensuring that individuals in distress are not left without support.

3. **Ensuring Legal Certainty for Businesses Providing Essential Services**
   - Businesses such as hotels, financial institutions, and money transfer services currently face legal restrictions preventing them from serving individuals without valid ID, even in emergencies.
   - By permitting biometric verification as an alternative, businesses would gain legal certainty, enabling them to provide services while complying with anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.
   - This would foster a regulatory environment where businesses can operate securely without fear of non-compliance penalties.

4. **Supporting Financial Stability Without Reducing AML Standards**
   - My proposal does not seek to circumvent AML or counter-terrorism measures. Instead, it strengthens them by ensuring that financial institutions can verify identities more reliably than with traditional document-based methods.
   - Fraudsters can obtain and present stolen or forged IDs, whereas biometric verification links an individual directly to their identity, making fraud significantly more difficult.

5. **Immediate Action Is Necessary**
   - The current system fails individuals who find themselves in emergency situations without identification, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and hardship.
   - Implementing biometric identification would provide a practical and secure solution that upholds security standards while ensuring that individuals retain access to essential services in times of crisis.

### Conclusion:
My proposal does not seek to lower security standards but to modernize and improve them. It offers a practical, secure, and technologically advanced solution to an issue that leaves many individuals vulnerable. By adopting biometric verification as a supplementary method of identification, we can enhance security while ensuring that EU residents have access to essential services when they need them most.

I urge the European Commission to consider these points and to support reforms that balance both security and accessibility in emergency situations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
